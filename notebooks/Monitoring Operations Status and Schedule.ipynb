    "The `misc_jwst` package installs a command-line tool `jwstops` which can be used to query and display various information about recent observations running on the observatory, observing schedules, and similar. \n",
    "Most of this information is obtained from [observatory log messages in the engineering database](https://github.com/mperrin/misc_jwst/blob/main/notebooks/Examining%20OSS%20Log%20Messages%20from%20the%20Engineering%20Database.ipynb), and/or other public information sources such as the posted weekly observing schedules.\n",

You may need to reload your shell or otherwise refresh your $PATH for it to show up. If you're installing this within a conda environment (recommended), you will need to have that conda environment activated to run the command line tool. \n",

    "**Usage overview**: The `jwstops` tool has various switches to display different outputs. Some examples are shown below, within this Jupyter notebook just for example documentation purposes. Generally the idea is you run this from your terminal command line, not in a Jupyter notebook. \n",
